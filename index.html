                    <h3>Proposed Problem</h3>
                    <p>Computer vision algorithms have become increasingly accurate and reliable in tracking the trajectory and precision of basketball shots, providing valuable insights into player performance. Hoop-tracking systems offer real-time feedback during training sessions, enabling athletes to correct their form instantly and optimize shooting performance. Incorporating these systems into training programs significantly enhances skill development by delivering personalized feedback. Customizing workout plans for individual players relies on advanced algorithms that assess body size, inputs, and composition, tailoring strength training to their needs while promoting injury prevention and muscle group development. Movement-tracking systems provide real-time feedback, helping beginners assess and correct their movements effectively, while self-development practices empower players with limited knowledge of player movement to improve their skills. Progress tracking and performance analytics identify individual strengths and weaknesses, facilitating targeted training interventions. Additionally, machine learning and predictive analytics enable the forecasting of future performance, offering deeper insights into areas requiring improvement and helping athletes reach their full potential through data-driven strategies.</p>
